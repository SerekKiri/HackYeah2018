# :runner: FitLocker

> Lessen social media addiction or fix obesity? Why not both?

### Stop wasting time on social media by being fit and healthy!

FitLocker restricts your access to apps of your choice until you gain enough points which are awarded by doing physical activities. FitLocker should reduce compulsive and uncontrolled usage of addictive apps.
